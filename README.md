# Depreciation Methods Analysis (Excel Project)

## 📌 Objective
To analyze and compare the **Straight-Line Method** and **Diminishing Balance Method** of depreciation using an Excel-based financial model, and evaluate their impact on asset value and expense recognition over the asset’s useful life.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel  
- Financial Accounting Concepts  

## 🧾 Asset Details
- Asset Cost: 500,000  
- Scrap Value: 50,000  
- Useful Life: 10 Years  

## 📐 Methodology
- **Straight-Line Method:** Depreciation is charged evenly across the useful life of the asset.  
- **Diminishing Balance Method:** Depreciation is charged on the opening book value, resulting in higher expense in earlier years.  
- Depreciation schedules and calculations were built using Excel formulas.

## 📊 Key Findings
- Both depreciation methods result in the **same total depreciation** over the asset’s life.  
- The Straight-Line method provides simplicity and consistent expense recognition.  
- The Diminishing Balance method accelerates depreciation in the initial years, reducing early-year profits.

## 💡 Business Insights
- Depreciation method selection impacts **profit timing**, not total depreciation.  
- Accelerated depreciation is suitable for assets with rapid obsolescence.  
- The choice of method should align with **financial reporting, tax planning, and business strategy**.
